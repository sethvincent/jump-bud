# jump, bud.
This is a game. An unfinished game.
It doesn't use the canvas tag. Instead it uses backbone.js and jquery to move some divs around.

The controls kinda suck. 

All the source files for the images are included in this repository. 
If you want to make improvements and push it back to this repository I'll give you credit. 
If you want to take this and use it to get started on your own game, that's cool, too.

Please just give me credit if the code/assets remain in recognizable form.
