# jump, bud.
[This is a game.](http://sethvincent.github.com/jump-bud) An unfinished game.
It doesn't use the canvas tag. Instead it uses backbone.js and jquery to move some divs around.

Sounds are added using buzz.js.

###todos:
- The controls kinda suck. Work on that.  
- Add sounds for player actions.  
- Add secrets.  



All the source files for the assets are included in this repository. Illustrator, Photoshop, Ableton Live, everything.  

If you want to make improvements and push them back to this repository I'll give you credit. 
If you want to take this and use it to get started on your own game, that's cool, too. Please just give me credit if the code/assets remain in recognizable form.
